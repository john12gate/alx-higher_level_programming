The project Python-Almost a Circle covers the basic aspects
of Import: where modules are imported, the  __name__ special
variable is been used to determine whether a file is been used 
as a module or script and the  __init__.py used.

The Exception handling concept is also been utilized where the 
try and except and the raise keyword are used. 

Also the concepts of class, private attributes,getter and setter;
class methods; static methods and Inheritance are looked into.

The unittest system as well as args and kwargs;JSON and 
serialization/ Deserialization concept were all used to come up
with solutions to the tasks given.
